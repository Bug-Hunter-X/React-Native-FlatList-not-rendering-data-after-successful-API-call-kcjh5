# React Native FlatList Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using FlatList in React Native where the component fails to render data even after a successful API call.  The issue arises from improper error handling or data processing within the `useEffect` hook. The solution illustrates how to properly handle the loading state, potential errors and ensure the data is correctly passed to the FlatList.

## Bug Description

The provided code fetches data from a sample API endpoint using the `fetch` API.  Despite receiving the data successfully, the FlatList remains blank.  The error might stem from asynchronous operations or incorrect data handling.

## Solution

The solution involves careful error handling in the `useEffect` hook and ensuring that the `data` state is updated correctly before rendering the `FlatList`.  The provided solution showcases this implementation.
